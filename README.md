# Awesome-Colorschemes

An awesome-style list for curating color schemes for every editor, and collections
of color schemes that are well-known.

It should be noted with "cross editor", when a scheme applies to all editors in the same way. It is rare
to find a scheme you like available in all of your editors.

Otherwise note with the editor to which the scheme applies.


Pull requests happily accepted.
